.SYNOPSIS
    Install Ollama if missing, then pull the ONE model this machine can run.

.DESCRIPTION
    Optional by design: the app also drives Anthropic and OpenAI/Azure from its
    Settings page, and the chat builder falls back to a deterministic engine
    with no model at all - so a machine without Ollama is a configuration
    choice, not a broken install. Nothing here fails the installation.

    WHICH model is not decided here. It comes from the app's own
    model_advice.recommend(), which sizes to the hardware - VRAM first, then
    RAM, then a CPU floor. Naming a model in this script would be a second rule
    quietly disagreeing with what the app's Settings page recommends, and the
    cost of being wrong is real in both directions: a 32B model on a laptop is
    unusable, a 1B model on a workstation is needlessly bad at spec JSON.

    One model, not a set. Each is several GB, and pulling a spread "just in
    case" turns a setup into a long download of things nobody will run.

.PARAMETER Model
    Pull this model instead of the detected one.

.PARAMETER SkipInstall
    Do not install Ollama; only pull, and only if it is already running.

.NOTES
    Windows PowerShell 5.1+. ASCII-only on purpose.
